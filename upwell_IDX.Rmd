# Upwelling

Upwelling is primarily caused by alongshore, equator ward winds. These winds are caused by cross-shore atmospheric pressure gradients, and these gradients occur predominantly during heating periods. Upwelling is defined as the process whereby cold, nutrient rich, high concentrated CO2, low pH, and low oxygenated waters are pushed to the surface as a result of alongshore winds interacting with the earth’s rotation

# Upwelling indeces
  # Determining upwelling index from wind data (SAWS)
  # Index Equation from Fielding & Davis 1989 paper

$$ UpwellingIndex = μ{(Cosθ − 160)}$$

In this equation μ represents the wind speed (m/s) and θ represents the wind direction which is measured in degrees. The 160 degrees is used as this refers to the angle of the coastline for the West Coast of South Africa (Fielding & Davis, 1989). This equation is dependant on wind speed and direction data in order to determining the intensity of the upwelling event. Wind data were obtained daily from the South African Weather Service (SAWS). These wind data were then matched to the date at which temperatures were collected. With these data the upwelling index was determined.
