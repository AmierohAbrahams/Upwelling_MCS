Loading the Wind data. The wind dataset was supplied by the SAWS in .text format. Wind data was provided for the sites closes to the requested site as wind data may not be available for the 6 study sites in this research.  The wind direction was collected every 2 hours and by using the circular function we calcuated the daily wind direction and mean speed. There is a numerically large gap between 360 and 2 where as in degrees its not as large. The circular mean function returns the mean direction of a vector of circular data. https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/circular/circular.pdf (Pg 130). The circular function creates circular objects around the wind direction.

Are there more SE winds in summer, but come later in January? i.e any changes in SE wind and changes in water temperature
To answer this first question we will take total counts of SE winds (180 - 270 degrees) for each year and counts for just summer (Jan - Mar). We will also take counts of each Summer month individually to see what the long-term trends are. Once we've pinned down any trends we will look at the same temporal agregations for temperatures to see what those trends are. With all of that determined we can then see what the relationship between the two is.

```{r}
# First filter out only the SE data
SE_renamed <- wind_renamed %>% 
  filter(dir >= 180, dir <= 270)

# Then create diifferent temporal results
SE_annual <- SE_renamed %>% 
  group_by(site, year) %>% 
  summarise(count = n(),
            mean_dir = mean(dir, na.rm = T),
            mean_temp = mean(temp, na.rm = T))
SE_summer <- SE_renamed %>% 
  filter(season == "Summer") %>% 
  group_by(site, year, season) %>% 
  summarise(count = n(),
            mean_dir = mean(dir, na.rm = T),
            mean_temp = mean(temp, na.rm = T))
SE_monthly <- SE_renamed %>% 
  filter(season == "Summer") %>% 
  group_by(site, year, season, month) %>% 
  summarise(count = n(),
            mean_dir = mean(dir, na.rm = T),
            mean_temp = mean(temp, na.rm = T))
# Plots

## Annual count of SE wind in Summer
### The trends between annual and summer SE wind counts are remarkably similar
ggplot(data = SE_summer, aes(x = year, y = count)) +

  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +

# March SE winds have been increasing in count in Hout Bay, Lamberts Bay, and Sea Point
# Feb winds are increasing faster in count in Saldanha Bay
# All SE summer winds are decreasing in Port Nolloth

  geom_line() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  facet_wrap(~site)
# The temperature trends for annual and summer means are very similar
# THe annual mean increase at Port Nolloth is steeper than the Summer increase
## Summer months mean SST
ggplot(data = SE_monthly, aes(x = year, y = mean_temp)) +
  geom_line(aes(colour = month)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(colour = month), method = "lm") +
  facet_wrap(~site)
# The trends in increasing temperatures for each month are similar at Lamberts Bay and Port Nolloth
# The incrase in March temperatures is greater than the other months at Hout Bay
# The decrease in temperatures per month at Saldanha Bay are similar per month
# Sea Point shows a more intersting pattern with January temperatures decreasing, Feb nearly flat, and Mar increasing

# Now having had a look at the data it appears there may be some relationships between SE wind and temperature
# at Sea Point, and perhaps a negative relationship atPort Nolloth

# This outputs the slope of the relationship and the correlation between
# annual count of SE winds mean temperature 
SE_annual %>% 
  group_by(site) %>% 
  do(mod = lm(mean_temp ~ count, data = .),
     mod2 = cor(.$mean_temp, .$count, method = "pearson", use = "complete.obs")) %>%
  mutate(Slope = summary(mod)$coeff[2],
         Pearson = mod2[1]) %>%
  select(-mod, -mod2)
# Summer stats
SE_summer %>% 
  group_by(site, season) %>% 
  do(mod = lm(mean_temp ~ count, data = .),
     mod2 = cor(.$mean_temp, .$count, method = "pearson", use = "complete.obs")) %>%
  mutate(Slope = summary(mod)$coeff[2],
         Pearson = mod2[1]) %>%
  select(-mod, -mod2)
# Monthly summer stats
SE_monthly %>% 
  group_by(site, season, month) %>% 
  do(mod = lm(mean_temp ~ count, data = .),
     mod2 = cor(.$mean_temp, .$count, method = "pearson", use = "complete.obs")) %>%
  mutate(Slope = summary(mod)$coeff[2],
         Pearson = mod2[1]) %>%
  select(-mod, -mod2)
```

It looks like there is generally a negative relationship between increasing summer winds and mean SST.
